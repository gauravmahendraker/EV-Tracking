# Challenges Faced:
1. The primary challenge was to provide a real-time tracking solution, i.e, to a lag-free experience that was as accurate as possible.

# Tech Stack:
1. Embedded JavaScript:
- Embedded Javascript is a simple template view engine that allows one to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- It enables web developers to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications.
2. MongoDB:
- MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented, highly scalable, robust, and free NoSQL database.
- It is a popular and widely used general purpose database management software.
3. Nodejs:
- Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
- Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
4. Socket.io:
- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications.
- It enables real-time, bi-directional and low-latency communication between web clients and servers.
- Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option.
- Socket.IO allows broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
5. Leaflet js:
- It is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- Simple, performant, and usable.
