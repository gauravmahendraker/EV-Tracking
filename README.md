# Purpose:
The website aims to provide students, visitors, and faculty of the campus with an easy way of finding the EV nearest to them, thereby reducing wait times. This will facilitate
easy travel between various parts of the campus.

# Challenges Faced:
1. The primary challenge was to provide a real-time tracking solution, i.e, to a lag-free experience that was as accurate as possible.

# Tech Stack:
1. Embedded JavaScript:
- Embedded Javascript is a simple template view engine that allows one to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- It enables web developers to create dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications.
2. MongoDB:
- MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented, highly scalable, robust, and free NoSQL database.
- It is a popular and widely used general purpose database management software.
3. Nodejs:
- Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
- Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
4. Socket.io:
- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications.
- It enables real-time, bi-directional and low-latency communication between web clients and servers.
- Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option.
- Socket.IO allows broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
5.Redis Pub/Sub:
- Redis Pub/Sub provides an efficient in-memory messaging system that enables real-time message broadcasting across multiple servers.
- It is used for handling high-throughput, low-latency data sharing, making it ideal for multi-server setups where live updates (like EV locations) need to be shared instantly with clients on different servers.
- Redis enhances scalability by allowing different server instances to synchronize and distribute location updates effectively.
6. Leaflet js:
- It is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- Simple, performant, and usable.
